PHP_extension
=============

PHP extension sample implementation 

First of all you need to install M4, libtool, automake, autoconf and GCC (at least GNU C++)

Install file script is used to compile and build the sample, it got configure, make and make install. Means $sudo ./install
You can test the .so file generated by enter $sudo make test 

To start to use the .so file generated you must add these lines to php.ini

[registerPM]
extension = /usr/lib/php5/20090626/registerPM.so

and restart apache server.

to test the global variables, you can set them into the php.ini file after the extension line:

registerPM.pm_enable = 1
registerPM.greeting = "bon giorno"

and don't forget to restart apache server :)
